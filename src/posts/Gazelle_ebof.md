Fenders with integrated lighting for the Gazelle Nr1 Concept

$$$



Giugiaro had designed a new concept bike for PON Gazelle. 
The challenge was to realize this design in a real product for a first small production batch. 
The light module for front and rear are the same to keep the number of parts & investment minimal.
