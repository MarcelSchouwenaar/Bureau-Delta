A bicycle lock with folding shackles and a code system for (un)locking

$$$



The development of the technical platform by Trelock was nearly done. 
In close collaboration with the Trelock team we explored how the appearence and interaction of the lock could be combined is the best way. 
Integrating the (un)locking functionality in a aesthetically pleasing way, combined with intuitive user-interaction and a good fit with the Trelock brand expression was a very rewarding job in this project.
