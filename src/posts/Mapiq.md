The smart desk sensor of mapiq detects if somebody is working on a desk. 
This information is being used in the software application Mapiq offers.

The desk sensor was designed in such a way that it will give a clear visual que to a office employee whether a desk is occupied or available. 
Other than that it was desired that the productsâ€™ presence was subtle. 
Technically seen the product had to be easy to install, yet robust to withstand impact of a chair rolling by. 
Good fun with the Mapiq team, from style reference upto engineered parts for production.
