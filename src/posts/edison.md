The Edison the Petit is a portable light for Fatboy.

$$$



Fatboy was mainly know for their bean-bags until they introduced the Edison the Petit. 
The product was developed from first cardboard model upto arranging production in China. 
When introduced the expected sales of 5K pcs annually turned out to be conservative and was adjusted to 75-100K pcs annually. 
This was the start of developing the 2.0 with production-techniques suited for big volume, optimizing assembly for repairability & improving the light effect with smart optics.
