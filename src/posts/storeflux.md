The Storeflux is a range of luminairs for Philips for the hospitality and retail market 

$$$



Philips allready had a LED module which they wanted to apply in a new range of fixtures for the retail and hospitality market as a successor of the conventional CMD fixtures. 
The range offers solutions for full-integration in a ceiling to conventional fitting in existing ceilings. 
The design is stripped from all visible technical details when installed. 
This is achieved by designing smart functional parts.
