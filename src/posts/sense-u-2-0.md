A compact and wearable ultrasound sensor which monitors the bladder of kids.
Children with urinary incontinence will receive a signal from the SENS-U to go to the toilet, hereby supporting in the prevention of urinary leakage

User-interaction, shape and aesthetics were explored for a subtle expression and comfort.
Combine this with smart puzzling of electronical components and the result is a unobtrusive design in a minimal volume. 
Assisting upto detailing of the mechanical parts for hi-quality mass-production.
Contributing to a product which minimises akward accidents is super fulfilling.
