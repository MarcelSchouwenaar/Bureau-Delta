$$$



The Trelock Lighthammer is a bicycle light. The product comes in severel versions for different light-output levels and mounting options.

$$$



This project is not so much about the light on it's own, but about the combination with the bike. 
Several key-clients of Trelock were involved intensively in the development process, from first visuals, 3D printed dummies upto functional samples. 
This resulted in a beautifull product range with a good marketfit.
