The Non-Random Light 2.0 is an luminair of the MOOOI random-light family.

$$$



The existing random-light family was based on a retro fit light bulb. 
MOOOI had the desire to create a new version with a integrated LED solution. 
A elegant shaped lightmodule making the beautifull non-random mesh structure the centre of attention. 
The architecture of mechanical parts in combination with a  LED configuration was generated to create a clean product fit and homogenous light effect.
